Project Idea
Mad Libs with Pictures!

MVP Criteria:

- CRUD app based on premise of Mad Libs

  - index page will have at least one link to a form to populate your mad lib
  - new page will be a form with the words to input
  - show page will render the completed mad lib with images from flickr searches based on the words inputed
    - this is where I will implement the one advanced CSS technique - probably have the page render and slide in from the side or something like that
  - there will be an edit page where you can tweak your saved entries and you can 
    delete them

Project Plan
Friday
- figure out Flickr api - this is really frustraiting, I have no idea how to even start with this

Saturday
- build basic CRUD features, test their functionality
- plan some style choices

Sunday
- style pages
- construct additional mad libs for the user

Monday
- work on bonus features (thinking about buttons to change styling - something like a joe button that makes the background green and replaces all of the images on the page with potatoes)

Tuesday
- write readme file
- deply to heroku
- more testing
- more styling as time allows
