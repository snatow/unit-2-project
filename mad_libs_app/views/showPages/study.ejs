    <p>Listen, <%= adjective1 %> teachers always give out <%= adjective2 %> assignments. But as everyone knows, if you want to pass all your classes so you can go to a/an <%= noun1 %> and become president of a big international <%= noun2 %> and have millions of <%= pluralNoun1 %> in the bank, you must do your homework and study <%= adverb1 %>. If you just sit around and <%= verb1 %>, you wonâ€™t get ahead in life. You must learn to pay attention to every <%= adjective3 %> think your teacher says. Do not interrupt or whisper to another <%= pluralNoun2 %> during class. Be sure to have a nice, <%= adjective4 %> notebook in which you can write down anything the teacher says that seems <%= adjective5 %>. Then go hoe and memorize all of those <%= adjective6 %> notes. When your teacher gives you a surprise quiz, you will know all of the <%= pluralNoun3 %>.</p>
